               <h2 id="internships">Internships</h2>

<p class="emphasis">The Technology Commercialization Office (TCO) provides a variety of internship opportunities for students to assist in the commercialization process of Ohio State technologies.</p>

    <h4>LAW STUDENTS</h4> <p>In their second or third year are recruited to support Licensing Team's to conduct prior art searches, intellectual property landscape analyses; research patents, patent applications, and publications; provide insight into the appropriate IP protection strategy for a technology; review contracts such as Material Transfer Agreements and licensing agreements; and review Office Actions for filed patent applications.</p>
    <h4>BUSINESS STUDENTS</h4><p>Work closely with Ohio State’s licensing teams to assess the commercialization potential of university inventions through market analysis and assessment; assist with business plan development, financial projections, and startup potential for technologies; conduct analyses into the markets to which an invention could be applied and aid in the creation of non-confidential marketing materials to send to potential licensees and generate interest in the technology.  Preference is given to undergraduate students with at least two full years of credits or current MBA students.</p>
    <h4>OPERATIONS INTERNS</h4> <p>Can be students from any major who fill additional critical roles at TCO including industrial design students, who help prototype inventions; software development, prototyping, and user experience students, who program and wire-frame smart phone and web applications; event management students, who help with large scale events hosted at or in collaboration with the TCO; and accounting students, who help reconcile receipts and invoices, work with the compliance team on royalty fulfillment, and data entry.</p>
    <h4>LICENSING STUDENT</h4> <p>Positions are available to PhD  or post-doctoral students in engineering- or science-related fields on a case-by-case basis.</p>
</ul>
<div class="callout">
    <h4 class="students">INTERNS</h4>
    <p>Student interns are a valuable part of the commercialization process, working alongside professionals in a collaborative environment</p>
</div>
<h2>CAST</h2>
<p class="emphasis">An acronym for Customer Aligned Startup Training, CAST is a program designed for students interested in commercialization and entrepreneurship, looking to learn the essential steps involved in creating a startup company.</p><p>  Undergraduate, graduate, and professional students from any program of study are  invited to apply for the program.</p>
<p>The semester-long program utilizes the Business Model Canvas  to guide students through the customer validation process. The TCO collaborates with faculty inventors and selects technologies to offer to CAST for study. Students choose technologies based on their program of study, expertise or interests. These students are afforded the unique opportunity to work alongside inventors, entrepreneurs, and Ohio State Licensing Teams to learn about the technology and to assist in identifying potential customers and determining a commercial path for the technology.</p>
<p>At the end of the semester, CAST students pitch their findings and recommendations at Wakeup Startup (should this be described here).</p>
<h2>BOSS Competition</h2>
<p>The BOSS (Best of Student Startups_Competition is the perfect opportunity for students who are already running their own business or who are looking for feedback on their own early-stage concept. To participate in the competition (offered during fall and spring semesters) students need only two things: an idea and the drive to work towards making it real. Operating on a first-come, first-serve basis, the BOSS Competition is available to the first thirty students – open to undergraduate, graduate, or professional students – who submit a one sentence description of their idea. What differentiates BOSS from other startup competitions is that the idea can be at any stage of development— no business model, monetization strategy, or exit plan required. Some of the ideas submitted for BOSS are already revenue-positive, while others were dreamt up the night before, but  each is given an equal shot at the big prize: a small amount of seed-funding and business development assistance from TCO.</p>
<p>The ideas for BOSS come pouring in from all across campus each semester and have included everything from medical devices to food-finding smart phone applications. BOSS lasts for the duration of the semester and the field is narrowed through a series of 3-4 pitch competitions.</p>
<p>Venture capitalists, Ohio State faculty and leadership, entrepreneurs from the community, and industry leaders are invited to serve on the judging panel for the finale. The student entrepreneurs are given the opportunity to ask for feedback and network with these judges before and after the event.</p>

<h2>Innovation, Creativity, and Entrepreneurship (ICE) Scholars</h2>
<p>The Student Wellness Center in the Office of Student Life, the Honors &amp; Scholars Center in the Office of Academic Affairs, and the TCO collaborated to create the 16th Scholars program at Ohio State: Innovation, Creativity, and Entrepreneurship (ICE). The unique relationship between the TCO and Student Wellness stemmed from the realization that some of the best and brightest students are leaving Ohio State to pursue their entrepreneurial ventures. ICE Scholars was created to improve retention of these students by emphasizing the importance of time management and overall wellness, giving students the tools necessary to chase their entrepreneurship dreams, and emphasizing the importance of leveraging Ohio State and Central Ohio resources available to ensure success.</p>
<p>Scholars Programs are interdisciplinary and open to all students who qualify for admission into Scholars (,based on academics, test scores, and extracurricular involvement). The Scholars Program focuses on out-of-classroom experiences and experiential learning. The ICE Scholars will engage in networking opportunities with successful entrepreneurs, innovators at the university, and other industry leaders; work to solve “pain points” through industry sponsored programs; learn about the lean business model canvas; be challenged to think outside the box; and be encouraged to question the norm and be innovative.</p>
<p class="emphasis">These students will commit to participating in the program for two years and are required to live on the same floor of Mack Hall during their first year.</p>
